# IOT-DLL (WIP)

## A minimalistic C Data Link Layer (DLL) protocol for the Internet of Things

This is a set of embedded C libraries which provides for a modular, flexible set of link layer protocols, focusing on the LLC protocols. This project is a work in progress.

The aim is to provide a simulator tool to determine the performance of data link algorithms, alongside the framework to implement the algorithms on an embedded device.

This project was spawned from a University of Southampton course, 'Embedded Networked Systems', which teaches students the fundementals of the layered network stack model and its applications in Embedded Networked Devices and the Internet of Things (IoT).
